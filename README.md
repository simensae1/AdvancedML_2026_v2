This is the repository of our Advanced Machine learning lecture.

To replicate our results:

1) Install all the requirements
2) Load the data via the file : load_data_and_models.py
3) Prepare the custom Yolo11 model (long, the model is saved and already ready to be used)
4) Create the data set to train the CNN : create_data_sets_for_1st_CNN_v2.py
5) Train the CNN : first_CNN.py (the model is already trained and saved)
6) Plot the results of the CNN : plot_results_cnn.py
7) Use the full model by giving the path to the image you want to analyse :  full_model.py
